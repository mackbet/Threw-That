# Threw-That
Simple hypercasual game, where you need to hit the ball in the hole.

The rules are simple. There are 5 at the beginning ball throws. By pulling the arrow you can control the strength and direction of the throw. A ball that touches the ground will not count. Hitting the hole scores 1 point and 2 extra throws.
